\section{Results}

Primary analyses were divided into two phases: hypothesis testing and exploratory analyses. For the main hypothesis testing, paired sample t-tests were conducted on all outcome variables to assess overall changes from fall to spring within each academic year. Following this, exploratory analyses began by using mixed-design ANOVAs with the within-subject factor being time and the between-subject factor being participant characteristics (e.g., sex and returner status) to examine whether changes differed as a function of participant characteristics. This approach allowed for the detection of interaction effects that would not be captured by t-tests alone. When significant interactions were identified, simple effects analyses were conducted to probe the nature of the interaction, typically by comparing change over time within each subgroup or comparing groups at each time point using estimated marginal means. Since key participant characteristics were dichotomous, post-hoc comparisons were not required. Additional exploratory analyses used independent sample t-tests to compare differences between returners and new membersâ€™ baseline scores. 

Returners start with lower scores of anger inhibition in academic year 1 (AY1) compared to new members (see table~\ref{tab:T1Comparisons_AY1}).

Returners ($T1$: $M = 36.11$, $SE = 2.48$; $T2$: $M = 39.67$, $SE = 2.02$) compared to new members ($T1$: $M = 37.47$, $SE = 1.92$; $T2$: $M = 34.53$, $SE = 1.57$) experienced greater gains in resilience scores, $F(1, 22) = 4.51$, $p = .054$, $\eta^2 = .159$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:Interaction_RRM}). Means from T1 and T2 of each group can also been seen in the bar graph (see Figure~\ref{fig:Bar_RRM}).
